## 📦 Online Sales Data Explorer 📦

Hello 👋
I created an interactive streamlit app for exploring consumer behavior in an online sales dataset, this is done through filtering based on region, payment method, and product category.

## Purpose:
- Explore content of the dataset
- Analyze purchasing behavior by region and payment method
- Identify top-selling product categories and items
- Examine monthly purchasing trends
- Identify key insights summarizing overall consumer behavior

## Structure:
I organized the app in three tabs with different purposes.

*🔍 Dataset Exploration
*🛒 Customer Purchasing Behavior
*💳 Payment Method Insights
## How to Use:
