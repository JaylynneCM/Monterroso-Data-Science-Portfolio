## 📦 Online Sales Data Explorer 📦

Hello 👋
I created an interactive streamlit app for exploring consumer behavior in an online sales dataset, this is done through filtering based on region, payment method, and product category.

## Purpose:
- Explore content of the dataset
- Analyze purchasing behavior by region and payment method
- Identify top-selling product categories and items
- Examine monthly purchasing trends
- Identify key insights summarizing overall consumer behavior

## Structure:
I organized the app in three tabs with different purposes and visualizations.
* 🔍 Dataset Exploration (To get an understanding of the dataset)
* 🛒 Customer Purchasing Behavior (Understand customer Regional insights)
* 💳 Payment Method Insights (Understand Payment methods utilized based on Region and Product category)

I used:
* Streamlit: For the interactive interface.
* Pandas: For data manipulation and filtering.
* Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating data visualizations and charts.

## How to Use:
* Install streamlit 
streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/main.py
